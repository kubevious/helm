# Kubevious Helm Charts
**Kubevious** brings clarity and safety to Kubernetes. Kubevious renders all configurations relevant to the application in one place. That saves a lot of time from operators, enforcing best practices, eliminating the need for looking up settings and digging within selectors and labels.

For more information refer to the root repository: https://github.com/kubevious/kubevious

## Notable Changes
Unfortunately, versions 0.7.25 or lower are not upgradable to the newer versions of Kubevious (0.7.26+). That was the reason of the delay between versions 0.6 and 0.7, as we wanted to pack all non-upgradable changes into version 0.7. The following changes were made that prevents seamless upgrades. 

- Helm charts were rewritten, allowing significantly more freedom of deployment configuration choices 
- The database schema was redesigned to improve query and old data purge performance
- MySQL now deployed with autogenerated root and user passwords

Significant changes to the Helm chart values were also made. We no longer configure public cloud specific annotations and resources. With such a variaty of environment options, it was impossible to maintain. Please see complete table of [configurations](#configuration) below.

A two-way feedback mechanism was added to Kubevious. It includes version checks, news updates, useful hints and tips,  and reporting of errors, cluster size metrics, and internal time counters. Participants would also see their clusters on a https://worldvious.io leaderboard map. Location is anonymized to the nearest city/zip. No IP address is stored or logged. We calculate the SHA256 hash of the IP address and use it as a key in the backend. If, for some reason, you do not want to participate, please see details of reporting [configurations](#configuration) parameters and instructions to opt-out (it's super easy).

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes v1.13 or higher
- Helm v3.2 or higher

## Installation 

First create a namespace:

```sh
kubectl create namespace kubevious
```

Add Kubevious repository and install the Helm chart:
```sh
helm repo add kubevious https://helm.kubevious.io
helm upgrade --atomic -i kubevious kubevious/kubevious --version 0.8.15 -n kubevious 
```

## Accessing Kubevious
Kubevious runs within your cluster. Upon successful completion of helm chart installation, you will see commands to access kubevious UI. There are two ways to access Kubevious UI. 

### Option 1. Access using port forwarding
The easiest but not most convenient method. Wait few seconds before pods are up and running. Setup port forwarding:

```sh
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods -n kubevious -l "app.kubernetes.io/component=kubevious-ui" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") 8080:80 -n kubevious  
```
Access from browser: http://localhost:8080

### Option 2. Expose using Ingress
Enable Ingress deployment using dedicated value parameters. See full list of [helm chart values](#configuration) to cofigure Ingress parameters.

```sh
helm upgrade --atomic -i -n kubevious \
    --version 0.8.15 \
    --set ingress.enabled=true \
    kubevious kubevious/kubevious
```

## Uninstalling the Chart
Undeploy from cluster:

```sh
helm uninstall kubevious -n kubevious
```

**IMPORTANT:** As requested by the community, now Kubevious Helm charts generate random MySQL root and user passwords. The Helm uninstall leaves behind the MySQL persistent volume. The same volume will be mounted if Kubevious is reinstalled into the same namespace using the same release name. That creates a big problem because Helm chart will generate new passwords for the backend to connect to MySQL, but the connection would fail because the mounted volume is initialized using the password generated using the initial installation. There are few solutions to this:

1. Delete the PersistentVolumeClain after *helm uninstall*:
```sh
$ kubectl delete pvc data-kubevious-mysql-0 -n kubevious
```

2. Install Kubevious providing your own root and user passwords. See *mysql.root_password* and *mysql.db_password* configuration values below.

3. Bit more complicated way is to update passwords in *kubevious-mysql-secret* and *kubevious-mysql-secret-root* Kubernetes secrets. Though wouldn't recommend going that route.
